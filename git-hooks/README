Git hooks used in phpMyAdmin
============================

These hooks are placed in

/home/scm_git/p/ph/phpmyadmin/scripts/hooks

where all other git repositories should look them.

Please note that from commit hook environment, this path is translated to:

/gitrepo/p/ph/phpmyadmin/scripts/hooks/

To make the hooks work, you need to configure them, in git configuration, 
for example:

[hooks]
    cia-project = phpmyadmin
    mailinglist = phpmyadmin-git@lists.sourceforge.net
